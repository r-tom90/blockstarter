## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app,
this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
